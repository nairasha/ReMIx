Prerequisites
-------------

1. In order to run ReMIx, reads aligned to 3'UTR of genes of interest 
	or all genes of the transcriptome) for individual samples are 
	equired to be available in FASTA format.

    For this, use the 3'UTR bed files located in the 'ref_files' 
	directory. Obtain the RNA-Seq aligned BAM files (Tophat preferred)
	for the samples of interest. Prepare the configuration file that
	contains corresponding paths as showed in the example config
	'bam_to_fasta.config.txt' that is included with the source code.
	Finally, submit the following command on an Open Grid Engine 
	compute cluster (note N below indicates the number of genes for 
	which the analysis is run - N would be 16 if genes listed in the 
	example config are used).
	Please provide the complete path to the configuration file while
	running the command:
		$ qsub -V -wd /dir/for/logs -m ae -M your@email -l h_vmem=6G -l h_stack=10M -q provide_queue -t 1-N ./generate_fasta_from_bam.sh `pwd`/bam_to_fasta.config.txt




2. Please have the following perl modules installed and ready to use 
	before proceeding to the next step (Running ReMIx).
	Statistics::PointEstimation
	Statistics::TTest
	Statistics::Basic


Running ReMIx
-----------------

To run ReMIx, a configuration file is required. A copy of the 
config file 'ReMIx_config.txt' is included with the source code. 

Once the config file is created, ReMIx can be invoked using the 
following command on an Open Grid Engine compute cluster (note 
N below indicates the number of genes for which the analysis 
is run - N would be 16 if genes listed in the example config 
are used).
Please provide the complete path to the configuration file while 
running the command.
	$ qsub -V -wd /dir/for/logs -m ae -M your@email -l h_vmem=6G -l h_stack=10M -q provide_queue -t 1-N ./ReMIx_wrapper.sh `pwd`/ReMIx_config.txt

The ReMIx results will be generated in the output directory that 
was proivded in the config file.
