## ReMIx
Bioinformatics approach to quantify microRNA response elements on RNA-Seq data

# Description:
The ReMIx approach has been applied to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer samples of all three molecular subtypes - Triple Negative (TN), estrogen receptor positive (ER+), and ErbB2 overexpressedâ€“HER2 positive (HER2+), to identify differential and tumor-specific microRNA response elements (MRE) unique to the TN subtype in breast cancer. This approach and the corresponding results on TCGA breast cancer dataset have been published at: 


Please refer to the README file to obtain information on some of the pre-requisistes and also on how to run ReMIx.
