# ReMIx
Bioinformatics approach to quantify microRNA response elements on RNA-Seq data


## Description
The ReMIx approach has been applied to close to 180 breast cancer (BRCA) cases with matched tumor and normal-adjacent samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort of all three breast molecular subtypes - Triple Negative (TN), estrogen receptor positive (ER+), and ErbB2 overexpressedâ€“HER2 positive (HER2+), to identify differential and tumor-specific microRNA response elements (MRE) unique to the TN subtype in breast cancer. This approach and the corresponding results on TCGA BRCA dataset are available at: [insert link to publication]
